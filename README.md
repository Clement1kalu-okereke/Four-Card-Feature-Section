## My Process

### Built With

2. CSS
3. Mobile first Workflow

### What i Learned

I got another chance to practice CSS Grid but i got the chance to practice grid template  areas
here is a piece of code i am proud of.

``` css
.card__container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: "supervisor middle calculator" "supervisor middle calculator" "supervisor middle calculator";
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### Continued Development

I am not yet comfortable with CSS Grid and i look forward to refining my skills on this concept
